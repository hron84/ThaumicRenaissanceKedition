Thaumic Renaissance - Kedition
==============================

This is a Thaumcraft 6 based modpack, everything here is Thaumcraft-related, 
whether it's Thaumcraft addons or some Thaumcraft linked tech mods 
(such as ImmersiveEngineering or EnderIO) that will keep you entertained as you
play with Thaumcraft.

The Research System is rebalanced and rewritten by TcResearchPatcher based on 
the Thaumic Merger (but not by the Thaumic Merger).

This modpack currently has some quests and they are only available in Chinese,
so if anyone would like to Englishize it I would be grateful.
(In fact, you don't need to translate it, you just need to write the usage of 
these items in English fluently)

This also my first modpack, if there are bugs or issues, please also point out, 
I will be very grateful for this.
