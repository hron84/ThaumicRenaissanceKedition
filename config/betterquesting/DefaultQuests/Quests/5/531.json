On the contrary, the softer (stone) items it digs will be very slow, and some squares that can be destroyed instantly (grass, for example) can't even be dug. \n As for bedrock... It's better to forget about it. \n\nAddendum: The 100 elemental crystal shards needed to craft the aberration pickaxe need to be obtained by digging up permeable stone. \nThe Permeable Stone is obtained by decaying rock abatement.",
