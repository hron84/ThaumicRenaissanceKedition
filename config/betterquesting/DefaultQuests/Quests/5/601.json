An idle golem nearby will process your request and take the item to the square you dive-righted - if you dive-righted a container, it will go straight in there, if you dive-righted a regular square, it will be dropped there. Of course if what you dive-righted was air, then the golem will give the item directly inside your backpack, as long as your backpack isn't full, otherwise it will drop the item at your feet.",
