      "desc:8": "The Basic Seal is the basis for players to manipulate golems, any golem can be manipulated as long as it meets the attributes required by this seal. \\n\\n Gathering Seal: This seal will request eligible puppets to pick up dropped items within range. The player can specify that the golem will only pick up certain items. \\n\\nStorage Imprint: this imprint will request that the puppet holding the item transport the item to the location of this imprint. If this imprint is affixed to the item's container, the golem will place the item in the container; otherwise the golem will drop the item on the ground. \\n\\n Vacant Seal: This seal can be affixed to one face of a container, and golems within range of effect will remove items from that container. \\n\\n Guard Seal: If a hostile creature is within range of this seal, the seal will request a nearby golem with combat abilities to come and destroy the creature. If the golem that kills the creature has Dexterity, it will drop experience orbs. \\Seal of Extraction: This Seal requests a nearby Golem with \"Destruction\" to dig up squares within its range. \\Seal of Provisioning: Similar to the Seal of Vacancy, but it will only provide items to other nearby Seals when they need them. \\n\\nStorage Seal: This seal only guarantees that a minimum number of items will be kept in the container.",
