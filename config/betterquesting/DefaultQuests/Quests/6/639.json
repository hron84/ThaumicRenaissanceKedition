      "desc:8": "The Dimension Ripper is a gadget for the §5 Mystic Wonderland§r module, it can be used to generate a rift at a fixed point, the specific operation is as follows: \n\nTwo Dimension Rippers are placed facing each other, and at the same time spaced 9 squares apart, when placed correctly, there will be a convection of purple particles. \n\nAfter that, you can pass contaminated source material into it, both rippers will consume 50 points of Vitium source material at the same time to perform a ripping activity, which will be used to open the spellwave fissure or expand the spellwave fissure, and inputting a redstone signal can pause the process. \n\n§ When receiving a Redstone signal, the Rippers will stop working but continue to absorb Vitium, absorbing more Vitium and then deactivating the Redstone signal will result in a stronger Ripping Activity. \n\n§cNote: A rift that is too large may swallow the dimensional ripper!",
