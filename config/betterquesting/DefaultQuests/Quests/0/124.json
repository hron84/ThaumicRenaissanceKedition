(Auram can be obtained from Silver Tree Logs; Praecantatio can be obtained from World Salt; Vitreus can be obtained from Glass.) Remember to dispose of too many elements by using shards! \\n\\nThen, synthesize the Core Inlay Table, to be placed in the block where your aura is most abundant, preferably the Enchanted Forest. \\n \"Close up to the flames\" requires you to stand in the fire and be burned by it to lose blood. \\When you succeed, a small purple text will appear underneath: \"You have felt the power of the flames\"\\n\\nSo, the door to the occult is now completely open to you!",
